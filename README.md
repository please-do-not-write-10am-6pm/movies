## üí° What is it
Movies is a real world isomorphic React application. **It's fast, responsive, with i18n and SSR built in support.**

Movies application utilizes real movies data API provided by [The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://www.themoviedb.org/). 

üìÑ **Note:** If you have some issues fetching data from TMDb, like in Russia (it is maybe due to country access restriction), you can try to enable some VPN extension in your browser or use Cloudflare DNS.
